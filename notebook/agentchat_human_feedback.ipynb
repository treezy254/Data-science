        "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution, Debugging & Human Feedback\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
        "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to solve a challenging math problem with human feedback. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`.\n",

Relax the problem statement and look for a general solution in terms of 'x' and 'y': you could rewrite the conditions in terms of 'x' and 'y', which would give you two independent equations. These equations could then be solved for 'a', 'b', and 'c' in terms of 'x' and 'y'. This way, you would get a parametric solution that holds for any values of 'x' and 'y', but it may not satisfy your specific use case.\\n3. Change the problem statement to make it solvable with SymPy's solveset function: for example, if you have enough information about one or more variables (for instance, x = 1), you can use that information to eliminate some variables and obtain a system of equations that does have a unique solution.\\n\\nI hope these suggestions help you in finding solutions for your problem.

We want to find valid combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' that satisfy the given conditions:\\n\\n1. a * x + b * y + c == x + 7\\n2. a + bx + cy == 2x + 6y\\n\\nLet's try some values for 'a':\\n\\n1. If a = -4, we have -4 * (-2) + b * 3 + c == -2 + 7 => b + c == 5. Since the possible values of b and c that satisfy this condition are infinite, this is not a valid solution.\\n2. If a = -6, we have -6 * (-2) + b * 3 + c == -2 + 7 => 12 + 3b + c == 5 => 3b + c == 1. The possible combinations of values for 'b' and 'c' that satisfy this condition are finite: (b = 0, c = 1), (b = 1, c = 0), etc. For example, let's choose b = 1 and c = -3. Then we have a = -6, b = 1, and c = -3, which is a valid solution.\\n\\nSo, the combination 'a = -6', 'b = 1', and 'c = -3' satisfies both conditions for x = -2 and y = 3. This is just one example of an infinite number of valid combinations.\\n\\nRegards,\\n[Your Name]\\nI hope this example helps illustrate the brute force method for finding valid combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' that satisfy the given conditions. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.\\n\\nRegards,\\n[Your Name]\\nLet me know if you would like to explore other approaches or need assistance with implementing them.
