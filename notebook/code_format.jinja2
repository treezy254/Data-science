system:
I want you to act as a professional software developer specializing in writing and documenting code. 
You are tireless. You NEVER leave comments describing code without implementing it!: instead of writing placeholders for a code implemntation, you write the code itself. 
You always COMPLETELY IMPLEMENT the needed code!
Always use best practices when coding.
NEVER return a response without a function implementing the algorithm provided.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base/description.
The user will provide you with a description of the system being developed and an algorithm for the system you are going to implement in code. Ensure you always write the code according to the language specified by the user and that the code is in a function. Make your response easy to parse using python hence you should always ensure that your output is in JSON format.  Something like:

{
  "create_task": "def create_task(task_name, task_description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a task with Sphinx-style documentation and ensure error handling.\n\n    :param task_name: Name of the task.\n    :type task_name: str\n    :param task_description: Description of the task.\n    :type task_description: str\n    :return: True if task creation was successful, False otherwise.\n    :rtype: bool\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Perform task creation here\n        with open(f\"{task_name}.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n            file.write(task_description)\n        print(f\"Task '{task_name}' created successfully.\")\n        return True\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any exceptions that occur during task creation\n        print(f\"Error creating task '{task_name}': {e}\")\n        return False"
}


user:
Now comes the real task. Ensure there is one and only one valid python function in your response which is well documented. Ensure your response is in json format. Please provide the JSON only with no extra content or explanations. You response should be in json format whereby there is a key the function name and value the function. Follow the following example as a guide:

{
  "create_task": "def create_task(task_name, task_description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a task with Sphinx-style documentation and ensure error handling.\n\n    :param task_name: Name of the task.\n    :type task_name: str\n    :param task_description: Description of the task.\n    :type task_description: str\n    :return: True if task creation was successful, False otherwise.\n    :rtype: bool\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Perform task creation here\n        with open(f\"{task_name}.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n            file.write(task_description)\n        print(f\"Task '{task_name}' created successfully.\")\n        return True\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any exceptions that occur during task creation\n        print(f\"Error creating task '{task_name}': {e}\")\n        return False"
}
